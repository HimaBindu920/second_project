      <h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>Git is a free, open-source version control software. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.
      <h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>When you're building an open source project, you'll need a way to document or track your code. This helps make your work organized, and lets you keep track of the changes you've made. This is what Git lets you do.
      <h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So they need a version control system like Git to make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.

      <h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
<h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>Anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.

<h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>If we want to start using GitHub, we need to know where to host our repositories.
<h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>A repository is a project that contains multiple files. In our case a repository will contain code-based files.
<h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>There are two ways you can host your repositories. One is online (on the cloud) and the second is offline (self-installed on your server).
<h3>For Creating your Own Repository</h3>

<h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>You have now created a repository, including a README file, and created your first commit on GitHub.com. You can now clone a GitHub repository to create a local copy on your computer. From your local repository you can commit, and create a pull request to update the changes in the upstream repository.
<h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman"></h4>Now you can Develop your own projects by using <b>GitHub</b> with so many great tools.
